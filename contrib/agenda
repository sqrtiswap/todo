# PURPOSE: Have an agenda for the day, that includes multiple different todo(1)
#          directories as well as perhaps the output of further tools like cli
#          calendars, etc.
#
#          In this example there are two TODODIR used that have to be exported
#          to be available, e.g. in the shell config:
#          export TODODIR=/path/to/a/tododir
#          export WORKTODODIR=/path/to/another/tododir
#
#          One might want something to use as a separator between the two (or
#          however many outputs). As an example there is drawsep, which can be
#          found at https://github.com/sqrtiswap/dotfiles/blob/main/bin/drawsep

	n=0

			n=1

			break
		fi
	done
}

show_tasks() {
	due_dates=$(grep "$1" "$TODODIR"/todo.txt | grep -oh 'due:[[:graph:]]*' | sort -u)
	if [ -n "${due_dates}" ] ; then
		check_due_dates
		if [ "$n" -eq 1 ] ; then
			#drawsep 'PRIVATE todo'
			todo today "$1"
		fi
	fi
